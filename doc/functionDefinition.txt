Several SN scriptlets require definition of a function, where the function may be anonymous,
and the system loads the defintion and then executes it.
Since just the function definition itself alone not a valid JavaScript scriptlet
(because without the wrapper it could never be invoked and therefore would be useless),
this module wraps the function in minimal code so make the entire script valid.
We report when this is done with messages starting with "Inserted or "Wrapped".

I fully acknowledge that this is an ugly hack, but the only alternative is not not validate at all.
Since we are modifying the provided code, this opens up the system to spurious errors when the
combination of the user code doesn't get along with the wrapping code.
A primary example of this is where the ServiceNow scriptlet allows for statements at the root level
after the required function definition.  Since we have to close the definition statement to avoid
a syntax error, if the provided code has any statement after the function definition, we will
close at the wrong point.
(Would avoid these problems by inserting the closing immediately after the function definition,
but without an AST library that's difficult if not unfeasible).
