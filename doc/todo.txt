Use variable name messageId instead of msgKey so that can leverage destructuring.

Cover other kinds of scripts:
For raw, and perhaps sys_ui_script, will need to capture full global-visible list from list page
like I did for form form sys_script_client scripts.
    sys_ui_policy .script_true, .script_false.  Both need a varsIgnorePattern for ^onCondition$
    sys_ui_script, global and non-global
    raw (like global sys_script and custom that load into browser).  Same as previous?
    sys_transform_map, sys_transform_script.  first IIFE with source,target,map,log,isUpdate
                       second IIFE source, map, log, target
    sp_widget, .script needs IIFE and has access to $sp, data, input, options
               and .client_script must define a function (at top?) and it may be an IIFE.
    sys_cb_topic.
        Must extract scripts from .graph JSON 'script' values and 'value' values that are strings.
    sa_pattern.
        Must extract scripts from .ndl custom language 'eval' values.
    sysevent_script_action.  Gets 'event' in addition to 'current'
    sys_security_acl
    sc_cat_item_producer.  Gets 'producer' in addition to 'current'
    sys_script_email.  need IIFE with current, template, email, email_action, event
    [not going to attempt sys_ui_ng_action, which runs on mobile.  Would need entirely different
     globals list and maybe parseroptions for mobile]

Rule enhancement.  Finish implementing validate-gliderecord-calls option grFactoryFunctions.
Look up variables set by these function calls.  Then check all of the checked GR functions on them.

Support table name specifications with dot, which are actually field specifications, for cases like
sp_widget scripts where the table has more than one script field.
