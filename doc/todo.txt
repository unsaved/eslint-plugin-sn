Use variable name messageId instead of msgKey so that can leverage destructuring.

Cover other kinds of scripts:
For raw, and perhaps sys_ui_script, will need to capture full global-visible list from list page
like I did for form form sys_script_client scripts.
    sysauto_script
    ui_action   See if this and next can be handled same as client scripts with custom globals.
    ui_policy
    sys_ui_script, global and non-global
    raw (like global sys_script and custom that load into browser).  Same as previous?
    transform
    sp_widget, .script and .client_script
    sys_cb_topic
    sa_pattern

Rule to add: No check of return of gr.insert, gr.update, gr.get

Enhance snLint.js to take any number of source file/pathsÂ¸ and just loop through them.

Enhance snLint.js to take directory paths.  Just get the matching files recursively in the branch,
to be consistent with 'eslint'.

Support table name specifications with dot, which are actually field specifications, for cases like
sp_widget scripts where the table has more than one script field.

Add fix capabilities
