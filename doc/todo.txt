Cover other kinds of scripts:
For raw, and perhaps sys_ui_script, will need to capture full global-visible list from list page
like I did for form form sys_script_client scripts.
    sysauto_script
    ui_action   See if this and next can be handled same as client scripts with custom globals.
    ui_policy
    sys_ui_script, global and non-global
    raw (like global sys_script and custom that load into browser).  Same as previous?
    transform
    sp_widget, .script and .client_script
    sys_cb_topic
    sa_pattern

Rules to add
    [update] sysid.  Give a.b.name as example

    [update] bad table/esscope:  attempt to remove all other issues when add this issue

    [update] require-iife.js
    constraints to add:  if any variable assigment within
    IIFE only at root level

    forEach instead of 'for (x ='
    Check again for an existing rule for this
    warn level

    Function declared at root level and then invoked once at root level.
    At least for non-SIs.

    Add rule to test for no check of return of gr.insert, gr.update, gr.get

    Once require-iife rule is implemented, make nonanony-iife to prohibit useless naming of IIFEs.

Enhance snLint.js to take any number of source file/pathsÂ¸ and just loop through them.

Enhance snLint.js to take directory paths.  Just get the matching files recursively in the branch,
to be consistent with 'eslint'.

Support table name specifications with dot, which are actually field specifications, for cases like
sp_widget scripts where the table has more than one script field.

Add fix capabilities
