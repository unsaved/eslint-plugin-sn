Use variable name messageId instead of msgKey so that can leverage destructuring.

Cover other kinds of scripts:
For raw, and perhaps sys_ui_script, will need to capture full global-visible list from list page
like I did for form form sys_script_client scripts.
    sys_ui_action, sys_ui_ng_action
        See if this and next can be handled same as client scripts with custom globals.
    sys_ui_policy .script_true, .script_false, 
    sys_ui_script, global and non-global
    raw (like global sys_script and custom that load into browser).  Same as previous?
    sys_transform_map, sys_transform_script  These both need IIFE
    sp_widget, .script and .client_script
    sys_cb_topic.  I think some need IIFE.
    sa_pattern
    sysevent_script_action.  Gets 'event' in addition to 'current'
    sys_security_acl
    sc_cat_item_producer
    sys_script_email.  need IIFE

Rule enhancement.  Finish implementing validate-gliderecord-calls option grFactoryFunctions.
Look up variables set by these function calls.  Then check all of the checked GR functions on them.

Support table name specifications with dot, which are actually field specifications, for cases like
sp_widget scripts where the table has more than one script field.
