Cover other kinds of scripts:
For raw, and perhaps sys_ui_script, will need to capture full global-visible list from list page
like I did for form form sys_script_client scripts.
    ui_action   See if this and next can be handled same as client scripts with custom globals.
    ui_policy
    sys_ui_script, global and non-global
    raw (like global sys_script and custom that load into browser).  Same as previous?
    transform
    sp_widget, .script and .client_script
    sys_cb_topic
    sa_pattern

Rules to add

    Function declared at root level and then invoked once at root level.
    At least for non-SIs.

    Add rule to test for no check of return of gr.insert, gr.update, gr.get

    The 'require-iife.js' rule is now just a stub.  Implement it.  There are implementation notes
    in the file as comments.

    Once require-iife rule is implemented, make nonanony-iife to prohibit useless naming of IIFEs.

Enhance snLint.js to take any number of source file/pathsÂ¸ and just loop through them.

Enhance snLint.js to take directory paths.  Just get the matching files recursively in the branch,
to be consistent with 'eslint'.

Support table name specifications with dot, which are actually field specifications, for cases like
sp_widget scripts where the table has more than one script field.
