Use variable name messageId instead of msgKey so that can leverage destructuring.

Cover other kinds of scripts:
For raw, and perhaps sys_ui_script, will need to capture full global-visible list from list page
like I did for form form sys_script_client scripts.
    ui_action   See if this and next can be handled same as client scripts with custom globals.
    ui_policy
    sys_ui_script, global and non-global
    raw (like global sys_script and custom that load into browser).  Same as previous?
    transform_map  These need IIFE
    sp_widget, .script and .client_script
    sys_cb_topic.  I think some need IIFE.
    sa_pattern
    sysevent_script_action.  Gets 'event' in addition to 'current'

Rule enhancement.  Finish implementing validate-gliderecord-calls option grFactoryFunctions.
Look up variables set by these function calls.  Then check all of the checked GR functions on them.

Support table name specifications with dot, which are actually field specifications, for cases like
sp_widget scripts where the table has more than one script field.
