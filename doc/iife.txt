These tables require IIFEs.
I derived this list by checking SN-provided scripts for all table scriptlet fields and I see
that ServiceNow only consistently wraps these scriptlets in IIFEs.
Based on that practice, I think it's clear that the scope is shared for other purposes
(thereby allowing for variable scope bleed that can be worked around with IIFEs).
If a scope is shared then using global-level "use strict" would either have no effect or could have
potentially disastrous side-effects.
Therefore, eslint-plugin-sn advises that users use IIFEs for these scriptlets (as does ServiceNow)
and we advise to use function-level "use script" when the ECMA level allows for use script.
For all other scriptlets we recommend global-level "use script" when the ECMA level allows for use
script.
