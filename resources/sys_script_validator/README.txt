ServiceNow has several very poor sys_script_validator records which will prevent you from
using modern JavaScript constructs from web editor, for .condition fields and fields of
types 'Script' and 'Script (Plain)'.
This directgory contains suggested sys_script_validator replacement
scriptlets, and I recommend that you deactivate the record for type 'Condition String'.
